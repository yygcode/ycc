* Wiki (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)
A trie or prefix tree, is an ordered tree data structure that is used to store
  an associative array where the keys are usually strings. Unlike an binary
  search tree, no node in the tree store the key associated with that node;
  instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which its associated.
  All the descendants have a common prefix of the string associated with that
  node, and the root is associated with the empty string. Values are normally
  not associated with every node, only with leaves and some inner nodes that
  correspond to keys of interest.

The term trie comes from retrieval. And is pronounced /ˈtraɪ/ "try".
