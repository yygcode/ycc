* Wiki (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree)
A radix-tree (also partricia tree or radix tree) is a space-optimized trie data
  structure where each node with only one child is merged with its child. The
  result is that every internal node has at least two children. Unlike a
  regular tries, edges can be labeled with sequences of characters as well as
  single characters. This makes them much more efficient for small sets (
  especially if the strings are long) and for sets of strings that share long
  prefixes.

A common extension of radix trees uses two colors of nodes, 'black' and 'white'
  . To check if a given string is stored in the tree, the search starts from
  the top and follows the edges of the input string until no further progress
  can be made. If the search string is consumed and the final node is a black
  node, the search has failed; if it is white, the search has succeeded. This
  enables us to add a large range of strings with a common prefix to the tree,
  using white nodes, then removes a small set of "exceptions" in a space-
  efficient manner by inserting them using black nodes.

As an optimization, edge labels can be stored in constant size by using two
  pointers to a string (for the first and last characters).
